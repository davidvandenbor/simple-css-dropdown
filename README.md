Example of a simple standalone dropdown menu. I tried to keep it elegant and scalable. You can drop it into any project with a minimum of effort. No dependency on Javascript! Just CSS!
I made/designed this menu for my current website at http://www.davidvandenbor.nl The previous version was the exact same design, but I wanted to strip the jQuery and Javascript code dependencies from it, so I decided to recreate the exact same menu (interactivity and animation) but with **just CSS**.
